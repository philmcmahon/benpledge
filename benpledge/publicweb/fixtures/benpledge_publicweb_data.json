A device which consumes 1W of power on standby, if left on standby all year, would cost \u00a31/year. Older devices can draw as much as 20W on standby so it's definitely worth investigating!"

Under the Green Deal, you can chose how to pay for energy saving works to your home, but if you use Green Deal Finance you will be able to do the works at no upfront cost. This new approach offers a loan to pay for the measures, which is paid off over an agreed period of time through savings on your energy bills. This is not a personal loan, if you decide to move after installing improvements in your home you will not be expected to take the loan with you to your new home. The loan stays with the property that has received the upgrade in energy efficiency.\r\n\r\nFor more information see http://www.bristolgreendoors.org/green-deal"

All of these are helping people and communities to meet real needs for both environmentally sound and affordable energy services. Read about some of our best projects here.\r\n\r\nCSE is an independent national charitable company that was initiated in 1979. "
